# Anime Quest
[Anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime) is a distinct type of animation that features distinctive storytelling, 
creative sensibilities, and cultural allegiances, making it a well-liked and significant form of entertainment all 
around the world. It was created in Japan and has since spread throughout the world.

**What Is `Anime Quest`, though? ðŸ¤”**

Itâ€™s a treasure of the anime world ðŸª™... Just kidding ðŸ˜‚â€¦ 

This public project is called Anime Quest, which used the [Selenium Python](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) 
to extract anime information from the [Anime Planet](https://anime-planet.com/) website. After processing the dataset,
[Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) is used to produce visualizations.

## Project Goal
Giving the project a data analysis tag will help us classify it more broadly. But after breaking down the wider concept, we can extract the project's goal, which is as follows:

1. [Scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) a [dynamic website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page) to extract details about anime.
2. Improve the extracted data's usability by processing it. a.k.a. **Data Processing**.
3. Use [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) to visualize the dataset to obtain valuable anime-related information.

***Other aspect of the project:***

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing the data thoroughly and utilizing visual means to learn various data characteristics.
2. **Automatic testing** of the scraper files.
