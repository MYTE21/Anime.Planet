[Anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime) is a distinct type of animation that features distinctive storytelling,
creative sensibilities, and cultural allegiances, making it a well-liked and significant form of entertainment all
around the world. It was created in Japan and has since spread throughout the world.

**What Is `Anime Quest`, though? ü§î**

It's a treasure of the anime world ü™ô... Just kidding üòÇ‚Ä¶

This public project is called `Anime Quest`, which used the [Selenium Python](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
to extract anime information from the [Anime Planet](https://anime-planet.com/) website. After processing the dataset,
[Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) is used to produce visualizations.

### Project Goal
Giving the project a data analysis tag will help us classify it more broadly. But after breaking down the wider concept, we can extract the project's goal, which is as follows:

1. [Scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) a [dynamic website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page) to extract details about anime.
2. Improve the extracted data's usability by processing it. a.k.a. **Data Processing**.
3. Use [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) to visualize the dataset to obtain valuable anime-related information.

***Other aspect of the project:***

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing the data thoroughly and utilizing visual means to learn various data characteristics.
2. **Automatic testing** of the scraper files.
3. Utilizing [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), create an experiment and data-driven web application.
"""

"""
### Resources and Websites
1. `Anime details` are collected using scraping from the [Anime Planet](https://www.anime-planet.com/) website.
2. Information about `anime countries` is gathered from the [Every Country's Favourite Anime](https://e.infogram.com/f2bfaed8-7046-43e6-aa41-367848a326ef?parent_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.broadbandchoices.co.uk%2Ffeatures%2Fevery-countrys-favourite-anime&src=embed#) website.
3. Data of `countries that watch the most anime` are collected using scraping from the [List of Countries that Watch the Most Anime](https://skdesu.com/en/list-of-countries-that-watch-the-most-anime/) website.
